<h1><span style="font-size: 20px;">What is the Ohio Schools Facilities Commission?</span></h1>
From their <a href="http://osfc.ohio.gov/Home.aspx">website</a>, <em>"The Ohio School Facilities Commission (OSFC) administers the state’s comprehensive Kindergarten through 12th Grade public school construction program. The agency helps school districts fund, plan, design, and build or renovate schools."</em> You can find out more about OSFC at their <a href="http://osfc.ohio.gov/Library/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.aspx">Frequent Asked Questions page</a>.
<div>1)  Why are voters being asked to approve this now?&nbsp;

The Ohio Schools Facility Commission is currently co-funding projects.  The state will pay for 65% of the cost, not including LFIs (locally funded initiatives).  We are not sure how much longer the funding will be there, and our elementary schools are out-dated and in need of major repairs.  We are fourth on the priority list for schools with a bond issue on the May ballot.  If we do not pass the bond issue, we will lose our priority and possibly our funding.  The time is now if we want a co-funded project to build new schools.  If we wait, tax payers could bear 100% of the cost.

Bond Issue:
Millage - 4.79 Mills
State Share - $16,976,634
Local Share - $13,696,531

Total - $30,673,165

2)  Why was this site chosen?

In November, the Board of Education looked at six possible sites for the new building.  It was narrowed down to two possible locations, the north site and the east site.  In January the facilities committee met with city, county, and township trustees to discuss both sites.  At the conclusion of that meeting, it was decided that we needed some figures on what the east site would cost.  In February, the facilities committee met with the architect and the pros and cons of each were discussed.  It was decided that the north site made the most sense.  The district already owned the land so there would be no land acquisition costs, the water and sewer lines were easily accessible because the property was within the city limits, and the state would co-fund the development of roads which would improve access to the current high school and housing developments in the area.

3)  What are some of the advantages of having a new Pre-K-6 building?

For our kids, they will have state-of-the-art technology and learning spaces that will promote a 21st century education.  A new building will also provide a safe and secure facility and a healthy learning environment for all students.  There will be expanded recreational spaces with a dedicated area for the performing arts.  The centralization of staff and educational resources will provide district-wide unification and equal opportunities for all students.  Most importantly, the students of the Kenton City Schools will have the same opportunities as the students who attend Ada, Hardin Northern, Riverdale, and USV.  They will not be at a disadvantage as they are now.

For our community, a new building would bring about growth for our community.  Good schools attract people to move here and become part of our community.  Kenton City Schools has achieved an “Excellent” rating, and the academic success of our students is still improving.  In order to take things to the next level, our students need access to technology, safe, healthy learning environments, up-to-date classrooms and science labs, etc.  There are also anticipated savings to tax payers by having one energy efficient building instead of four out-dated facilities that are in need of major repairs.  These repairs would be 100% the taxpayers’ cost.

4)  Is Silver Street going to be extended to the site?

As part of our initial plan and discussions, Silver Street will be extended to create more accessibility to the elementary school.  We have been told by the architects that this will be a co-funded project with the state.  In the proposed plan we will also be creating a road that will connect Harding Avenue to Township Road 114.

6)  What items are parts of the LFI (Locally Funded Initiatives)?

Additional academic space per Feb. 3, 2011 and a result of the loss in square footage from the new OSFC guidelines in January.  $3,125,424

Standing Seam Metal Roof (included in the basic project budget)

Terrazzo flooring in common areas and corridors.  $23,000

Geothermal  $669,843

Site/Utilities  $300,000

7)  What are the plans for the buildings that won’t be serviced anymore and how will this be funded?  What is going to happen to the old schools?

In the OSFC master plan, monies have been set aside for the demolition and abatement of Eastcrest, Espy, Hardin Central, Northwood, and Westview; however, no decisions have been made at this point.  Once the bond issue is passed, the building advisory council, in conjunction with the facilities committee, will meet to discuss each school individually to determine what the best purpose is for each site.  The good news is the demolition and abatement costs have already been budgeted, if that is what needs to be done.

8 )  Will a new school be safer for the children in the district?

Yes, with limiting the access to the building, state-of-the-art cameras, and an accessible office  area, security will be greatly increased.  Every person entering and exiting the building will be monitored making it a safer place for everyone.

9)  What will be the benefit of a new Pre-K-6 building to Middle School and High School students?

The current Middle School has to use trailers to accommodate the over crowding in the building.  By moving the sixth grade to the new building, those trailers can be eliminated, as well as the overcrowding concerns.  By making a campus setting with all the schools being in close proximity to each other with easy access, there are many more opportunities to share resources which create the possibilities for more electives and opportunities for high school students.

10)  What are the educational advantages for K-6 students?

All the resources would be available to all students.  Staff would have the opportunity for collaboration which would allow for district unification in curriculum and instruction.  By eliminating travel time, specials teachers would have the opportunity to teach additional time to lengthen classes or decrease class size.  The learning spaces and state-of-the-art technology would give our students the best opportunity to learn and be prepared for the 21st century.

11)  Will a new building help keep children from open enrolling in other districts?

Although we can not be sure, we can look at the other districts in the county and look at how their open enrollment numbers have greatly increased since they built new elementary schools.  We have also seen a significant increase in students leaving the Kenton City Schools, and a decrease in overall enrollment since our neighboring schools have completed OFSC building projects.

12)  Will there be community involvement in the building of the new building?

Yes, once the bond issue is passed, a building advisory council will be established to design and build the new facility.  This committee will consist of administrators, teachers, support staff, board members, the treasurer, parents, and community members.

13)  What is the plan if the building project doesn’t pass?

To be honest, we don’t know.  We would like to say that we would address the concerns, and put the bond issue back on the November ballot; however, the letter we received from the OSFC in March clearly stated that if we do not pass in May, we would lose our priority status and there were no guarantees beyond that point.  We would be in a wait and see mode.

14)  Is there a floor plan for the new buildings?

Although how the space will be used (number of classrooms, cafeteria, gym, work room, offices, etc.) has been determined based on the enrollment, the actual layout of the building has not.  The building advisory council in conjunction with the architects will work together to design the space.

15)  My child walks to one of the neighborhood schools.  How will my child get to and from the new school building?  Where will my child meet the bus?

With the one elementary school, the ways students are bused will have to change.  We will work through that process with our transportation director to ensure that students can be easily transported to the new school.  We have also requested that the two new access roads have sidewalks and lighting so students who live close to the north site could have a safe way to walk to school.

16)  What is going to happen to the items (desks, computers, SMARTboards, etc.) in the old buildings?  Will there be an auction/auctions?

The OSFC building project accounts for the purchase of all new furniture and technology for the new building.  Any state-of-the-art equipment such as computers, SMARTboards, etc. would be put into classrooms at the Middle School and High School.  Furniture, out-dated technology, etc. would probably be sold in an auction/auctions.

17)  Will any of the programs that have been cut within the district in the past year be able to be reinstated if there is a new building constructed?

Programs are typically cut because of a lack of funding.  If the district can save money by restructuring grades Pre-K-6 into one building, and the funding is there to support additional programs, the programs should be able to be reinstated.

18)  Will there be staff reductions with a new building?

Staff reductions will be based on enrollment and funding.  If the district unifies and all of our staffing and resources are available under one roof, there may be room for reductions; however, the number of students enrolled will likely not change and probably will increase.  This would be a reason that there would not be any significant cuts in staffing.  Student enrollment in the building will drive the staffing needs.

19)  Why did Kenton lose more square footage than Ridgemont?

There was a decrease in enrollment at Kenton since the OSFC did their initial evaluation several years ago.  This did decrease the amount of square footage, however in January, the OSFC reduced the amount of square footage for all building projects.  Although all areas were affected, school districts building elementary schools faced the biggest reduction.  Ridgemont is planning to build a K-12 building, so they did not lose as much as Kenton.  This is one of the reasons that you will see the increased square footage as one of our LFIs.  The Board of Education felt that it was important to build the largest building possible with the most classrooms that we could.  We did not feel that the newly allotted square footage would be adequate to house all of our elementary students.

20)  How can we afford this if the state is cutting back funding for the next year?

Although the state’s reduction in funding will affect Kenton, the bond issue is a completely separate issue.  We can take the appropriate actions and provide a high quality education for our students, however we can not take the reduction, provide a high quality education for our students, and fund the repairs of our existing buildings.  The repairs and maintenance to our current facilities would be at 100% of the cost to the Kenton City Schools and the taxpayers.  We know the OSFC funding is there for our project if the issue is passed in May.  There are no guarantees beyond that point.

21)  At some point in time will we be mandated to upgrade our elementary buildings due to the number of building code violations and will this cost us double (or how costly would this be) since there will be no state funding?

The only thing I can guarantee is that any upgrades, maintenance, and repairs to our buildings already cost the taxpayers more than double because we pay 100% of the cost.  If a new building is built, it would cost 45% of the cost (with LFIs included).  When OSFC did their cost analysis many years ago, it was determined that our buildings were beyond repair.  There was no way to upgrade them to meet current building codes.  We will be responsible for maintaining and repairing our buildings, and we face major costs within the next five years.  We know that most of the roofs will have to be replaced as they can no longer be patched and are leaking.  There are also issues with flooding and heating just to name a few major repairs that must be done in the near future if we maintain our current buildings.

22) Aren't all classes going online? Will we even need buildings in the future?

No, classes aren't going completely online, the computer is not a replacement for a highly qualified teacher. Although some coursework is currently being completed online, these classes are usually for courses not available at Kenton City Schools. More classes will have an online component in the future, but this will be as an enhancement, not replacement, for classes. Schools will exist in their current form for years to come.`
